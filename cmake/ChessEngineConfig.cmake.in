 # This is the configuration file template used to generate ChessEngineConfig.cmake
 # during installation. It is used by consumers who do:
 #
 #     find_package(ChessEngine REQUIRED)
 #
 # @PACKAGE_INIT@ sets up necessary variables and paths (like CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR).
 # We then include the ChessEngineTargets.cmake file, which defines the library targets
 # so the consumer can link with ChessEngine::ChessEngineLib or similar.
 #
 # This file is processed by configure_package_config_file() in CMakeLists.txt to produce
 # the final installed config file.
